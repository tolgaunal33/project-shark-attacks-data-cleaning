# 🌊 Surf for the Entire Family: Shark Attack Analysis 🦈

# 🏄‍♂️ Project Overview
"Surf for the Entire Family" is a surfing school company exploring potential locations to establish new surf schools. As part of the initial research, we are analyzing the Shark Attack dataset to gain insights and make data-driven decisions about safer surfing spots. The project focuses on identifying patterns in shark attacks across four popular surfing destinations: Mexico, Australia, Portugal, and South Africa.

# 🔍 Hypotheses
We aim to validate the following hypotheses using the Shark Attack dataset:

Surfing has the highest association with shark attacks.

Popular tourist destinations have more shark attacks due to increased water activity.

Shark attacks peak in summer, aligning with increased beach activity.

Select beaches in Australia, Mexico, Portugal, and South Africa show lower fatal shark attack rates, making them safer options for surf schools.

# 🛠️ Technologies/Tools

Python

Pandas library

We'll utilize these tools to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The project includes implementing at least five data cleaning techniques to address issues such as missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.

# 📊 Data Analysis and Visualization

The analysis covers data exploration for shark attacks across the four countries. Various visualizations are used to support our hypotheses:

Bar Charts: To compare the frequency of shark attacks by country and activity.

Pie Charts: To analyze the distribution of shark attacks by activity type (e.g., surfing, swimming).

Line Charts: To examine trends in shark attacks over time and identify seasonal patterns.

# 🚀 Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/tolgaunal33/data-cleaning-pandas`

`cd data-cleaning-pandas`

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

`python3 -m venv env`

source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:

`!pip install openpyxl`

Download the Shark Attack dataset (if not included in the repository) and place it in the data/ folder.

Run the analysis:

`python analysis.py`

# 📊 Usage

The project involves exploring and analyzing the Shark Attack dataset to draw insights related to surfing safety. Each contributor focuses on analyzing a specific hypothesis:

Data Cleaning: The script includes multiple techniques like handling missing values, removing duplicates, and fixing formatting issues.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The analysis.py script contains functions to generate visualizations using bar charts, pie charts, and line charts.

Country Analysis: The analysis specifically looks at shark attack data in Mexico, Australia, Portugal, and South Africa to assess their safety levels for establishing surf schools.

Results: After running the analysis, the results will be saved in the results/ folder as plots and summary reports.

To run the analysis, simply execute:

`python analysis.py`

The script will generate outputs like charts and CSV reports to summarize findings for each hypothesis.
